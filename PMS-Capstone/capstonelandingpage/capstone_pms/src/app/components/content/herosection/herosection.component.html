      In hospitals, the practice of medicine is not just about treating
      illnesses and injuries, it's about caring for the whole person. This quote
      by the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates speaks to the idea that
      medicine is not just a science, but an art that requires compassion and
      empathy for those in need. It reminds us that the best hospitals are those
      where patients are not only treated with the most advanced medical
      techniques, but also with kindness and understanding.
